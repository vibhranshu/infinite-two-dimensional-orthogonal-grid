<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>Imagine an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two</p>
<p>possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are
directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</p>
<p>At each step in time (tick), the following transitions occur:</p>
<p>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by loneliness.</p>
<p>2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</p>
<p>3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</p>
<p>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.</p>
<p>The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' (randomly placed 500 cells) of the system. The first generation is
created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed â€” births and deaths happen
simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is called a tick. (In other words, each
generation is a pure function of the one before.)</p>
